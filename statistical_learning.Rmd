# Introduction

Statistical learning plays a key role in science, finance, industry, and many more areas. This book is about learning from data:

- supervised learning (presence of outcome variable for learning)
- unsupervised learning (outcome variable is not observed)
Examples:
- classification of spam emails
- explain prostate specific antigen from clinical measurements via regression
- image classification of handwritten digits
- clustering of DNA microarray data for cancer diagnostic
