# An Opinionated Survey of Methods for Mixed Linear Models

The general notation of mixed linear models is $y = X\beta + Zu + \epsilon$, where the observation $y$ is explained through a design matrix $X$ connected to fixed effects $\beta$, a design matrix $Z$ connected to normal random effects $u$, and a normally distributed error $\epsilon$. The covariance matrix of the random effects $u$ is a function of unknowns $\phi_G$. "All of the oddities and inconveniences examined in this book arises because $\phi_G$ is unknown."

Old-style versus new-style random effects.
